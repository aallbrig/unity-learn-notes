### Unity Learn Notes
This repo contains notes I take while going through [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com). Mind maps leverage the [Mind Map plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8045-idea-mind-map) for jetbrains (a.k.a intellisense) IDEs.

Suggestions for myself while taking notes:
- Take notes in the form of mind maps
- Review notes by creating markdown pages afterwards
- Be pragmatic in notes. This is to help me capture useful concepts and be a better game programmer.
